**LAPL** is an interpreted programming language designed from the ground up to be useful. It features **dynamic typing**
but only **explicit casting**, **user-defined scoping**, **functions-within-functions**, etc. It's expressive, it's
probably quite similar to a language you already know, it has been designed to run on
Unix systems and it's very easy to learn. If you keep reading this readme, by the end of it you will be a LAPL expert.

excessively expressive, readable,
fast and easy to learn. It mimics plain English, in the likeness of the good parts of older programming languages like COBOL, with the desire that it can be understood by anybody. LDPL was designed to run on Unix systems, including AMD-64 Linux, macOS, ARMv8 Linux, Android Termux and both Intel and PowerPC OS X (tested from Tiger 10.4 onwards). It even supports UTF-8 out of the box.

// Variables names in LAPL start with the sigil $. Variable names
// can only contain characters a-Z, numbers and underscores (_).
$foo = 10;
$bar = "hello"; // Every statement in LAPL ends with a semicolon (;).
$biz = true; $foobiz = true; // Multiple statements can be in a single line.

$bar = $foo; // Variables are dynamically typed and created.

// There are three scalar types in LAPL: numbers, strings and booleans.
$number = -1.918237; // This is a number.
$string = "This is a string.";
$boolean = false; // This is a boolean.

// Expressions in LAPL are typed with one of these three scalar types.
// Types cannot be mixed within expressions without casting.

$number = ((12387 * 123) / (2 ** 89) - 5) % $number + 17;
